# ProGlove — Wearable Scanners (TSA Webmaster Tryout)

## Description
This website demonstrates a foreign wearable technology — ProGlove (Germany) — and explains how wearable barcode scanners could benefit local warehouses, retailers, and manufacturers.

## Writeup

Our team first researched foreign wearables developed outside of the USA and focused on improving daily tasks and processes, as opposed to those for consumer or health-related applications. In doing so, we found “ProGlove,” originated in Germany and used as an industrial wearable in factories, logistics, and warehouses. Our team examined the official documentation and global case studies of ProGlove as well as various wearables described within many technology-related publications, noting the successful implementation of ProGlove technology within Europe. The thing that caught our attention was the applicative utility of this technology. ProGlove is simply an embedded, compact barcode scanner on the palm side of a regular work glove, which helps complete tasks more efficiently and lessens the likelihood of mistakes. After researching various other foreign-developed wearables, we felt that ProGlove suited our objectives and requirements because it is known as an established and used technology on a global level.
