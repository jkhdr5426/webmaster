      <h2>How this wearable helps our community</h2>
      <p>
        Primary beneficiaries: warehouse workers, retail stock teams, local manufacturers, and small distribution centers. Hands-free scanning reduces repetitive strain from handheld scanners and increases throughput by allowing workers to scan while carrying items.
      </p>

      <h3>Pilot plan (simple)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Partner with a local warehouse or retailer for a 2-week pilot (10–20 workers).</li>
        <li>Procure 5–10 MARK devices as trial units (or request a vendor test/demo).</li>
        <li>Measure baseline: average scans per hour, error rate, and worker feedback.</li>
        <li>Deploy ProGlove devices for 2 weeks, then compare metrics and collect qualitative feedback.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Estimated costs (rough)</h3>
      <p>
        Device cost varies by model and vendor; expect several hundred dollars per unit (pricing and vendor discounts vary). Include incidental costs for chargers and training. A small pilot budget estimate: <strong>$2,500–$6,000</strong> depending on number of units.
      </p>

      <h3>Real-world considerations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Connectivity: BLE or proprietary RF depending on terminal ecosystem.</li>
        <li>Worker acceptance: short training, clear benefits (less fatigue) increase adoption.</li>
        <li>Maintenance: battery charging schedule and spare units recommended.</li>
      </ul>
