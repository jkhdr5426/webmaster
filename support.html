        <h2>How ProGlove Benefits Our Community</h2>
        <p>
        ProGlove’s wearable scanner system supports a wide range of local industries — including warehouses, retail backrooms, small manufacturers, and distribution centers. By replacing traditional handheld scanners with a lightweight, glove-based device, workers can scan items while keeping both hands free. This reduces physical strain, speeds up common tasks, and helps prevent repetitive-motion injuries.
        </p>

        <h3>Simple Pilot Plan</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Partner with a nearby warehouse, manufacturer, or retailer for a 2-week trial (10–20 participating workers).</li>
        <li>Obtain 5–10 ProGlove MARK scanners for testing, either through purchase or a vendor demo program.</li>
        <li>Record baseline data: scans per hour, pick accuracy, task completion times, and worker experience.</li>
        <li>Deploy the ProGlove units for 2 weeks, then compare productivity data and gather feedback from the team.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Estimated Costs</h3>
        <p>
        Exact pricing varies by model, but ProGlove scanners generally cost a few hundred dollars per device. Additional costs include charging stations, accessories, and brief user training. For a small-scale pilot, the expected budget ranges from <strong>$2,500–$6,000</strong>, depending on quantity and vendor discounts.
        </p>

        <h3>Real-World Factors to Keep in Mind</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Devices connect via Bluetooth Low Energy or ProGlove’s proprietary radio, depending on the workstation setup.</li>
        <li><strong>Training & Adoption:</strong> Workers learn the device quickly. Reduced fatigue and faster scanning help encourage long-term use.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Establish a charging routine and keep a few backup scanners ready to ensure smooth daily operations.</li>
        </ul>
